# D2QN // Double Q-Learning Agent with Keras DeepNN Q-Function Approxmation

This repo implements a Deep Double Q-Learning Agent for OpenAI's Gym using Keras NN Primitives on top of Theano/TensorFlow
It is intended to be easy to make experiemnting with network configuration, different tasks, and RL tuning and testing over relatively large runs easy and straightforward.

# Usage
